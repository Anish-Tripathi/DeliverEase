# 🚚 DeliverEase – Simplifying Logistics, Smartly

DeliverEase is a logistics simulation platform that allows users to place, track, and manage deliveries with a realistic and interactive interface. Designed as a pure frontend application, it demonstrates the full flow of a logistics system—from order placement to vehicle tracking—using only **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Geolocation API**, and **OpenStreetMap**.

> 🔧 Built without a backend, DeliverEase intelligently simulates logistics processes with real-world mapping and user interactions.

# 🚚 DeliverEase – Simplifying Logistics

DeliverEase is a lightweight yet powerful logistics simulation app designed to demonstrate intelligent route planning and delivery visualization in real-time. Built for educational and demo purposes, it simulates parcel delivery with interactive map features and dynamic updates.

> ⚡ Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenStreetMap API

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Interactive Map View**  
  Visualize delivery points and paths on a real-world map using OpenStreetMap.

- 📦 **Parcel Pickup & Drop Simulation**  
  Simulate pickup and delivery actions with smooth transitions and marker updates.

- 🗺️ **Custom Routing System**  
  Simple but effective pathfinding for delivery sequences.

- 🎯 **Real-time Status Updates**  
  Updates on current parcel location and delivery status dynamically.

- 🎨 **Clean, Responsive UI**  
  Mobile-friendly design with intuitive UX, styled with custom CSS.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Frontend  | Map Integration      |
|-----------|----------------------|
| HTML5     | OpenStreetMap API    |
| CSS3      | Leaflet.js           |
| JavaScript (Vanilla) |           |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Define Delivery Locations**  
   User selects pickup and delivery locations on the map.

2. **Simulate Delivery Movement**  
   A moving marker indicates the current delivery position along the path.

3. **Dynamic Updates**  
   Status updates and visual changes occur as the parcel reaches checkpoints.
